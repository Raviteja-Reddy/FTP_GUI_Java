# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)


It was my End semester project i.e. creating this FTP having a user interface in Java. It simply sends file from Client to Server but not the other way around. Obviously you can do that as well. Plus, there are a lot of exceptions to handle which can also be done. I just did my part ;p
